# Day-in-the-Park-WWDC18

My submission for the WWDC18 Scholarship! 

The idea was to create a short, fun Playground Book with a "children's book" feel.

All assets were drawn in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com), all music was made in [GarageBand](https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/garageband/id682658836?l=en&mt=12), and all voices were made by myself (in a process that may or may not have involved getting a lot of weird looks).

If you do take the time to check it out, please give me a shout as I'd love to hear your thoughts on it :)
